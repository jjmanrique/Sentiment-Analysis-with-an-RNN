# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN

Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service. This field had many improvements with the advances of deep learning techniques and the increasing popularity of social networks.

In this project formerly presented to the Facebook Pytorch Scholarship Challenge, I trained a Recurrent Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis on users reviews from the IMDB website. The main goal was to identify if the critics were positive and negative with Supervised Learning. Note that preprocessing plays a great part of this project, as expected. The training process was made with Pytorch on a GPU in Google Colaboratory.
